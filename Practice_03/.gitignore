# Notes & recommendations
# =========================
# - Keep these folders/files under source control:
#     /Assets/** (your scenes, scripts, prefabs, art)
#     /Packages/manifest.json  (should be tracked)
#     /ProjectSettings/**      (should be tracked)
#
# - If you have editor/team-specific settings you want to share (eg. .vscode/settings.json),
#   remove .vscode/ from .gitignore and commit the settings file(s).
#
# - Large binary assets (textures, audio, models, video) can quickly bloat repo.
#   Use Git LFS for those file types rather than ignoring them. Example LFS patterns:
#     *.psd
#     *.png
#     *.jpg
#     *.tga
#     *.psb
#     *.fbx
#     *.blend
#     *.wav
#     *.mp3
#     *.mp4
#   (Don't add these to .gitignore — configure with git lfs track "*.psd" etc.)
#
# - If you already pushed unwanted files (eg. Library/), after adding .gitignore run:
#     git rm -r --cached Library
#     git add .
#     git commit -m "Remove ignored files and add .gitignore"
#
# - Always keep /Packages/manifest.json và /ProjectSettings/ tracked so project loads correctly on other machines.
